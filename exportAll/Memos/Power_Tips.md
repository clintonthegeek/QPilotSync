Power Tips

• To improve your Graffiti� accuracy, write letters BIG. (Having trouble with  "V"? Try writing it backwards.)

• In Date Book Day View, press the scroll button on your handheld to move backward and forward one day at a time. To move an event to another day or time, tap Details and change the day or time there. 

• In Note Pad, To Do List, and Memo you don't have to tap New to create a new record; just start writing. In Note Pad, this creates a title for a new note or drawing.  In Date Book, this creates a new UNTIMED event. To create a new TIMED event, just write the time in the Graffiti number area.

• To set up your business card for beaming, go to Address Book and select your own name & address. Tap Menu. Then tap Select Business Card.

• To quickly find an application icon in the Launcher, switch to the All category and use Graffiti writing to write the first letter of the application's title. The icons with titles starting with that letter spring to view.

• Want to change your alarm sounds? In Date Book, Note Pad, or Clock, choose Preferences from the Options menu.
