Four Ways to Enter Text

1. Type into your Desktop software, attach your handheld to the cradle, and press the HotSync� button to transfer the typed data.

2. Use the onscreen keyboard. In the Graffiti� writing area below, tap the dot below "abc" for the alphabetic keyboard or the dot below "123" for the numeric keyboard.

3. Use the stylus to write Graffiti characters in the writing area. Characters are mainly uppercase, single-stroke letters. Write letters on the left, numbers on the right. 

Note: To call up a Graffiti reference screen, drag the stylus from the bottom of the writing area to the top of the screen. Or see the Graffiti Reference Card.

4. Connect a portable keyboard to your handheld and type the data directly into your handheld.
